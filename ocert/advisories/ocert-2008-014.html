    <p><b>#2008-014 WordNet stack and heap overflows</b></p>

    <p><b>Description</b>:</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> 3.0 Unix library
    and command-line interface suffer from a number of stack overflows due to their
    handling of command line arguments, environment variables and data read from
    user supplied dictionaries.</p>

    <p>The oCERT team was contacted by Moritz Muehlenhoff from the Debian
    project requesting an audit of the WordNet code base. These vulnerabilities
    were the findings of the requested audit.</p>

    <p>Stack overflows fed via the command line, environment variables or
    WordNet library calls can result in arbitrary code execution.</p>

    <p>Stack and heap overflows via modified WordNet dictionaries may allow arbitrary
    code execution.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that despite the ease with which arbitrary code can
    be executed via these WordNet flaws, unless WordNet is being used by a daemon or web
    service running as a user other than that of the attacker, this is unlikely to
    result in privilege escalation or the ability to take any action not already
    possible as the attacking user.</p>

    <p>The following patch fixes the issues:
    <a href="../analysis/2008-014/wordnet.patch.2">wordnet.patch.2</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Affected version</b>:</p>

    <p><a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a> = 3.0</p>

    <p><b>Fixed version</b>:</p>

    <p>Princeton unfortunately lack the resources to produce a new release of this code and will therefore not be releasing a new version as a result of this audit.</p>
