    <h1 class="title">Open Source Computer Security Incident Response Team</h1>

    <p>The oCERT project was started in March 2008 and dismissed in August 2017.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>

    oCERT was a public effort to provide security vulnerability mediation for
    the open source community, maintaining reliable security contacts between
    registered projects and reporters that needed to get in touch with a specific
    project regarding infrastructure security issues or projects vulnerabilities.

    <br/><br/>

    The project was announced at the CanSecWest conference in March 2008, at a
    time where efforts like Google Project Zero or bug bounties programs where long
    to be introduced. The oCERT effort was very much ahead of its times.

    <br/><br/>

    The idea spawned from the quite obvious need for coordinated vulnerability
    investigation and disclosure among open source projects, particularly with multiple
    libraries statically included by a vast number of software.

    <br/><br/>

    To this end Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco from Inverse Path along with
    Will Drewry and Tavis Ormandy from Google, decided to create oCERT. The team
    was complemented by Solar Designer and Dragos Ruiu as advisory board members.

    <br/><br/>

    The project contributed 61 advisories covering vulnerabilities ranging from
    single project bugs, to critical findings affecting core libraries and a
    multitude of projects sharing their code, up to entirely new classes of
    vulnerabilities affecting multiple compilers.

    <br/><br/>

    The oCERT project was sponsored by <a href="https://inversepath.com">Inverse Path</a>,
    <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> with hosting kindly provided by the
    <a href="https://osuosl.org">OSU Open Source Lab</a>.

    <br/><br/>

    oCERT was authorized to use the CERT mark by Carnegie Mellon University's
    Software Engineering Institute; however, oCERT has never been otherwise
    affiliated or endorsed by Carnegie Mellon University or its <a
    href="http://www.cert.org">CERT Coordination Center</a>.

    <h2>Advisory archive</h2>

    <p>All published advisories are archived <a href="advisories.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure policy</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All membership requirements and responsibilities were publicly known.
            <br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
            Distribution was determined in two ways, registered
            vendors/maintainers and extracted Open Source project contacts
            from authoritative resources like
            code.google.com/sourceforge/rubyforge/etc where applicable.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            oCERT agreed to keep things moving efficiently, acknowledging that long or
            moved embargo dates can have significant impact on vendors, users and open
            disclosure and will be avoided where possible.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            All bug/incident timeline and discussion summary were made
            public after an embargo date. The embargo was optional and  applied only
            when considered necessary for appropriate coordination, reports were released
            as early as possible and in any case embargo was not longer than 2 months.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            The following time frames regulated oCERT embargo proposals:
            <br /><br />
            * 7 days, in case the issue is already well narrowed down and tested, requiring trivial
              configuration and/or code change
            <br /><br />
            * 14 days, standard embargo for most cases
            <br /><br />
            * 30 days, in case of critical and complex vulnerabilities (example, trivial exploitation
              of administrative privileges on a static library affecting a large number of packages),
              and with the agreement of all parties
            <br /><br />
            * under extremely exceptional circumstances, if the oCERT Team and all the parties involved
              felt the need for longer time, a 2 months embargo was applied, in this case we would clearly
              document the decision for public review
            <br /><br />
            * in any circumstance reporter preference was always honoured in case a joint agreement
              was not reached, as oCERT would be anyway unable to force its embargo
            <br /><br />
       </li>
  </ul>
