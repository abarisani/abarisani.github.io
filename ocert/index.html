    <p><b>The oCERT project was started in March 2008 and dismissed in August 2017.</b></p>

    <p>

    oCERT was a public effort to provide security vulnerability mediation for
    the open source security community, having reliable security contacts between
    registered projects and reporters that need to get in touch with a specific
    project regarding infrastructure security issues.

    <br /><br />

    oCERT was authorized to use the CERT mark by Carnegie Mellon University's
    Software Engineering Institute; however, oCERT has never been otherwise
    affiliated or endorsed by Carnegie Mellon University or its <a
    href="http://www.cert.org">CERT Coordination Center</a>.
