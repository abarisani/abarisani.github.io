- Information -----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a presentation that was developed for the 10th
anniversary of the HITB conference (October 2012).

For the occasion we kept it old school with an in-depth exploration of specific
aspects of reverse engineering and exploitation of embedded systems.

Topics covered (in reverse order because...Inverse Path):
  
  - The first successful Apple SMC reverse engineering and tampering attempt.

  - Runtime kernel patching.

  - A dissertation on reverse engineering standard and not-so-standard checksum
    algorithms.

  - Hardware basics such as identification and probing of debugging and I/O
    ports on undocumented circuit board layouts.
