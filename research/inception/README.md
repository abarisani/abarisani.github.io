*incomplete/dead project*

Information
===========

Since our original TEMPEST presentation [1] was released we always dreamed to
take the "Inverse Path" when it comes to TEMPEST attacks.

In the years following our original presentation on keystrokes sniffing, we
attempted to create the first known example of *constructive* TEMPEST
interference, in other words, constructive RF glitching, to inject keystrokes.

We never quite made it to a fully controllable PoC but we had an interesting
time testing the feasibility, and limits, of our approach.

Following the honorable tradition of previewing unfinished research at the
first PXE, we discussed this material at the third Phenoelit eXchange Event in
May 2014.

This directory contains slides and two demo videos of our incomplete PoC,
hereby presented for posterity.
