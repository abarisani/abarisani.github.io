- Abstract --------------------------------------------------------------------

Secure Boot schemes are a fundamental security feature which enables hardware
trust anchor necessary to achieve unattended confidentiality and integrity on
embedded systems deployed in the field. An ever increasing number of safety
critical embedded systems, such as vehicle infotainment or telematics units,
leverage on such feature to protect sensitive assets such as Intellectual
Property, certificates or Personally Identifiable Information (PIP).

This presentation delves in real-life experiences in developing, testing and
compromising Secure Boot schemes of all kind, aimed at proposing practices,
techniques and frameworks to improve the security of its various
implementations.
