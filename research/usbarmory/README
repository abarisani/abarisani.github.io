- Abstract --------------------------------------------------------------------

The availability of modern System on a Chip (SoC) parts, having low power
consumption and high integration of most computer components in a single chip,
empowers the open source community in creating all kind of embedded systems.

The USB armory from Inverse Path is an open source hardware design,
implementing a flash drive sized computer for security applications.

The presentation explores the lessons learned in making a small form factor,
high specifications, embedded device with solely open source tools, its
architecture and security features such as secure boot and ARM TrustZone
implementation.

Leveraging on the current maturity of the project, the defensive and offensive
uses of the USB armory are also fully explored, covering topics such as the
INTERLOCK application, its Genode OS support and its role and usage in
identifying new vulnerabilities affecting widely deployed USB stacks.
