Abstract
========

We are building an Open Source https://transparency.dev/ witness, in
collaboration with Google. This project entailed creating new hardware (USB
armory LAN with PoE) and software (Trusted OS and Applet) leveraging on TamaGo
and GoTEE frameworks. This presentation aims to discuss the journey of this
project, achievements (such as bare metal Go IRQ handlersâ€¦in space!) and
results.
