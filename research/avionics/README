- Information -----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a presentation that was developed for an event at
Politecnico di Milano, named "The Internet of Broken Things".

The presentation aimed at providing some insights in our long experience with
security testing in the aviation sector.

The material is quite limited to the heavy restrictions in disclosing actual
projects, it however attempts to give a representative overview.

The video link, to put slides in perspective, is highly recommended.
