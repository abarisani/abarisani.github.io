Title: Injecting RDS-TMC Traffic Information Signals
       a.k.a. How to freak out your Satellite Navigation

First presentation: April 2007 - CanSecWest

- Abstract --------------------------------------------------------------------

  RDS-TMC is a standard based on RDS (Radio Data System) for communicating over
  FM radio Traffic Information for Satellite Navigation Systems.

  All modern in-car Satellite Navigation systems sold in Europe use RDS-TMC to
  receive broadcasts containing up to date information about traffic conditions
  such as queues and accidents and provide detours in case they affect the
  plotted course. The system is increasingly being used around Europe and North
  America.

  The audience will be introduced to RDS/RDS-TMC concepts and protocols and
  we'll show how to decode/encode such messages using a standard PC and cheap
  home-made electronics, with the intent of injecting information in the
  broadcast RDS-TMC stream manipulating the information displayed by the
  satellite navigator.

  We'll discover the obscure (but scary!) messages that can be broadcast (and
  that are not usually seen over legitimate RDS-TMC traffic), the limits of
  standard SatNav systems when flooded with unusual messages and the role that
  RDS-TMC injection / jamming can play in social engineering attempts (hitmen in
  the audience will love this!).

  In order to maximize the presentation we'll also demo the injection...
  hopefully at low power so that we won't piss off local radio broadcasts.
